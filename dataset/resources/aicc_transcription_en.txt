This is Emily from Oak Tank Fire Insurance, dedicated to providing excellent service. How may I assist you today? I have auto insurance with your company, and yesterday I scratched my car while reversing. If I file an insurance claim, will my premium increase? Could you please provide your vehicle registration number? It's 123RA5678. Thank you for confirming. When did the accident occur? Yesterday. Thank you for confirming. Have you received an estimate for the damage? The repair shop quoted 500,000 won. I understand. I'll proceed with filing the claim for you. Oh, actually, I'm not trying to file a claim right now. I just want to know how much my premium would change if I did file a claim. I see. In that case, let me transfer you to the relevant department. Please hold for a moment. Okay. This is Jason from Oak Tank Fire Insurance, committed to providing excellent service. How may I assist you? I scratched my car yesterday while reversing, and I'm wondering how much my premium would increase if I file an insurance claim. Could you please provide your vehicle registration number? It's 123RA5678. Thank you for confirming. Do you have an estimate for the damage? Yes, 500,000 won for repainting the bumper. I see. If you file the claim today, we can process it within your comprehensive coverage limit. But what I'm curious about is how much my premium will increase when I renew my policy if I file a claim. That's why I called, but why do you keep telling me to file a claim? Pardon? Oh, you didn't call to file a comprehensive coverage claim? No, if I file a claim and get compensation, won't my premium increase when I renew my auto insurance? That's what I want to know, but you keep transferring me and asking the same questions! I apologize for the confusion. So, you're inquiring about the potential premium increase for your next policy renewal, is that correct? Yes, exactly. If you could calculate how much it would increase, I can decide whether to file a claim or not. I apologize, but premium calculations are handled by our contract department. I'll transfer you to them now. Oh, alright. Thank you. This is Sophia from Oak Tank Fire Insurance, dedicated to providing excellent service. How may I assist you? I scratched my car and I'd like to know how much my premium would increase if I file a claim and renew my policy later. So, you're not extending or applying for a new policy now, but want to calculate the potential increase for a future renewal, is that correct? Yes, that's exactly it. Could you please provide your vehicle registration number? It's 123RA5678. I see. Your current policy was issued on December 7, 2021, and expires at midnight on December 7 this year. Right. So, if I file a claim, I want to know how much my premium will increase when I renew on December 7 this year. I'm sorry, but we can't calculate that at this time. What?! Why can't you calculate it?! I apologize, but our system doesn't allow for such advance calculations. Are you kidding me?! I've repeated my vehicle number multiple times and been transferred around just to be told it can't be calculated?! How are you going to calculate it when I renew my insurance later?! Are you going to do it by hand instead of using a computer?! I sincerely apologize for the inconvenience. While we can't provide an exact calculation for this scenario, would you be interested in a rough estimate, even if it's less accurate? Well, I guess that's better than nothing. Thank you. Could you please confirm the contact number where I can reach you? My mobile number is fine, right? Yes. It's 010-8437-7677. Thank you. We'll calculate an estimate and get back to you. Is there anything else I can help you with? No, that's all. Thank you. Then I'll conclude our consultation. Thank you for your patience.
