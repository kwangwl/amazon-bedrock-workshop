# Amazon Bedrock Workshop - Advanced

### Introduction
This workshop aims to practice the basic functions and patterns of Amazon Bedrock, learn real-world cases (AICC) through prompt engineering, and build applications using Bedrock Agent.
Through this workshop, you will acquire various skills using Amazon Bedrock, from basic to advanced levels.

### Target Audience
This workshop is designed for engineers, data scientists, and developers interested in generative AI and machine learning.
It is suitable for those with basic knowledge, and also includes advanced content for experienced users.

### Objectives
1. **Bedrock Features and Patterns**: Understand the basic functions of Bedrock and practice building simple applications.
2. **Prompt Engineering**: Learn and practice prompt engineering methods based on the Artificial Intelligent Contact Center (AICC) case.
3. **Bedrock Agent Application**: Build a stock analysis application using Bedrock Agent.

### Key Technologies
- [Amazon Bedrock](https://aws.amazon.com/bedrock/): A fully managed service for using foundation models. It allows access to models from Amazon and third parties using a single API set for text and image generation.
- [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/): Quickly create web frontends for Python code without frontend development skills. Streamlit is useful for creating proofs of concept (PoC) that can be shown to both technical and non-technical audiences.
